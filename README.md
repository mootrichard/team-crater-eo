# Dev Setup Instructions

Make sure to run `npm install` at the top level of the project, and if you're working on the front-end, change directories to `client/` and run `npm install` again.

To fire up the server locally for development, you can run `npm run dev` and that should start the main Express server and the mini front-end server that will serve up the React application.

Before running these, you should make sure that ports 3000 and 3001 are available for these to run on.

You can find a description of how those are working [here](https://www.fullstackreact.com/articles/using-create-react-app-with-a-server/).
